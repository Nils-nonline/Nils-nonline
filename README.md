<h1>Hi, I’m @Nils-nonline</h1>

I’m programming with HTML/CSS/JS.
I am also quite good at coding in python.

I am also generally capable of but am not using as frequently:
Java and C++/Arduino.

My Interests:
  - Maths
  - AI (especially GPTs, AI-Agents and Stable Diffusion; Reasoning LLMs and how they work as well as related technologies such as RAG)
  - IT in general

Feel free to visit the website of the organisation I am part of and check out the projects I was involved in: www.neverstudio.de

I have also taken part in multiple hackathons from Hack To The Future. You can see  the projects we built on my profile.
